# Project Caelus Encoder PCB
This is a custom PCB we designed to streamline the control system for our liquid-fueled rocket tests. It combines signal encoding, ignition control, and ESP32-based automation into one board, letting us send multiple control signals through a single ethernet cable and run timed sequences automatically.
